    <div> <p style="color:dark black;"> 1. Acceptance.
        (a) These terms and conditions of sale (these "Terms") are the only terms which govern the sale of the goods (“Goods”) and services (“Services”) by Dynapar Corporation ("Seller") to the purchaser of such Goods and or Services ("Buyer"). If the subject of the sale is software-as-service (“SaaS”), then the additional terms contained in any attached SaaS agreement also applies. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a written contract signed by both parties is in existence covering the sale of the Goods or Services covered hereby, the terms and conditions of said contract shall prevail to the extent they are inconsistent with these Terms. If the Goods or Services covered by the Agreement (defined below) are capable of collecting, storing (including remotely) or transmitting information, then the additional terms in Schedule A shall also apply to such Goods. If the sale under the Agreement includes Services (except for SaaS), then the additional terms in Schedule B shall also apply to such Services. If the sale under the Agreement includes software (except for SaaS) (whether alone or in conjunction with hardware), then the additional terms in Schedule C shall also apply to such software.
        
       (b) Any offer, including without limitation any quotation or proposal or similar document, referencing these Terms is capable of acceptance only on the terms stated in such offer and these Terms, and any such offer is expressly conditional on acceptance of these Terms and those contained in the offer without the addition of any other terms whether or not such terms conflict in any way with those of the offer or herein. Any quotation/confirmation of sale/invoice issued by Seller (the "Sales Confirmation" accompanying or referencing these Terms (Sales Confirmation and Terms are collectively, this "Agreement") comprise the entire agreement between the parties, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, negotiations, representations and warranties, and communications, both written and oral. These Terms may be modified by inclusion of different terms on Buyer’s quotation or order acceptance documents but not by inclusion of any terms on documents provided by Buyer. These Terms prevail over any of Buyer's general terms and conditions of purchase regardless of whether or when Buyer has submitted its purchase order or such terms. Fulfillment of Buyer's order does not constitute acceptance of any of Buyer's terms and conditions and does not serve to modify or amend these Terms. Buyer expressly waives the right to enforce any terms other than those in the Agreement including, without limitation, any terms proposed or supplied by Buyer.
        
        (c) The Terms also apply to all channel partners, distributors, and resellers who sell or license the Services.
